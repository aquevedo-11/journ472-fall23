## About this lab

To complete this lab, you need to: \* run existing code as directed (look for **Task**). \* modify existing code as directed (look for **Task**). \* write code in empty codeblocks provided to answer questions included (look for **Q**). \* write out the answer in the form of a complete sentence in the space given (look for **A**).

When you are finished, commit changes and push to your personal GitHub repo, then submit the URL to this document on ELMS.

## Load libraries and establish settings

You'll need to load three packages for this: the tidyverse, lubridate and janitor.

**Task** load these three packages.

```{r}
# Turn off scientific notation
options(scipen=999)

# load your packages
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(janitor)

```

For this lab, we want to investigate spending by Maryland state and local candidates during the previous election. For example, we could ask how much money have candidates and committees spent on advertising on Facebook? Which vendors received the most money for media expenses? We have the data, but it's messy - names of payees are spelled differently and capitalized differently - and we need to clean it up. We'll use a combination of RStudio and OpenRefine to do that.

The basic process here is to start in RStudio, export data so that we can use OpenRefine to clean it up, and then bring it back into RStudio to finish our analysis.

## Load Data

You'll need to load one data set, a CSV file of Maryland campaign expenditures located in the data folder called "maryland_expenses.csv"

**Task** Create a codeblock below, then read the data in and assign it to an appropriate variable name. You'll want to clean up the column names and make sure that any date columns are actually date datatypes.

```{r}
# Load the Maryland expenditures data table

maryland_expenses_og <- read_csv("data/maryland_expenses.csv")

maryland_expenses_og |> mutate("expenditure_date"=mdy("expenditure_date"))

#head(maryland_expenses_og)

cleaned_maryland_expenses_og <- maryland_expenses_og |> clean_names()

```


## Answer questions

**Q1.** You've been assigned to write about Maryland political committees' use of Facebook advertising. There's a category column in the data that has values for different kinds of spending. One of them is "Media". You'll need to complete the following steps:

   1. Create a dataframe of Media expenses where the name of the payee is not NA.
   2. Then, using `write_csv`, make a CSV file of your media expenses in your data folder. `write_csv()` is similar to `read_csv()` but you provide it with the dataframe you're writing and the file path.
   3. Using OpenRefine, create a project using that CSV file, create a copy of the `payee_name` column called `payee_clean` and then standardize it, focusing on the payees that appear most often. Pay particular attention to variations of Facebook, bearing in mind that it changed its name in 2021: <https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/facebook-company-is-now-meta/>), but also clean up variations of the most common payees.
   4. When you are done standardizing `payee_clean`, export it as a new CSV file to your data folder, *giving it a different name* and read it back into RStudio as a new dataframe.
   5. Using that `payee_clean` column in your new dataframe, calculate the total amount of Facebook spending by each committee and present the results showing the committee that spent the most first.

**A1.** Jain  Ashwani Friends of spent the most ($36485.00) on Facebook.

```{r}
cleaned_maryland_expenses_og |>
  filter(
    str_detect(expense_category, "Media"),
    ) |>
drop_na(payee_name) |>

#media_only_md_expenses <- cleaned_maryland_expenses_og |>
```    
```{r}
write_csv(media_only_md_expenses, "data/media_only_md_expenses.csv")
```

```{r}
media_only_md_expenses_or <- read_csv("data/media_only_md_expenses_or.csv") |>
  
mutate(expenditure_date=mdy(expenditure_date)) |>

filter(str_detect(payee_name, "FACEBOOK")) |>
group_by(committee_name, payee_clean) |>
  summarise(amount = sum(amount)) |>
arrange(desc(amount))

#cleaned_media_only_md_expenses_or <- media_only_md_expenses_or |> clean_names()

```


**Q2.** Let's do some research on the top committees from question 1. Look up the top 10 spenders: if they are candidate committees, what offices were they running for? If they were not candidates, what issues do they seem to care about? Write some sentences answering those questions, then go the Facebook ad library ([https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&ad_type=political_and_issue_ads&country=US&sort_data\\[direction\\]=desc&sort_data\\[mode\\]=relevancy_monthly_grouped&media_type=all](https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&ad_type=political_and_issue_ads&country=US&sort_data\%5Bdirection\%5D=desc&sort_data\%5Bmode\%5D=relevancy_monthly_grouped&media_type=all){.uri}) and look for ads from the top spender. What do you notice about the the information provided about those ads?

**A2.** 
All top spenders were politicians or local officials within the state of Maryland. One retired politician was particularly interested in public health and served on multiple committees for health and government operations. Another top spender was a candidate for chief deputy of a MD county.
Re: info provided for ads from Jain Ashwani - status of add, it's active dates, platforms the ad was available on, and states regarding audience/engagement (audience size, impressions, ROI) are provided.

**Q3.** Given the list of top spenders in A1 and the primary results for governor (<https://elections.maryland.gov/elections/2022/primary_results/gen_results_2022_1.html>), who is missing from that Q1 list? Did those campaigns run Facebook ads? Who are the biggest recipients of media expenses by the Democratic primary winner for governor (HINT: that person has two committees, the second one with his running mate)?

**A3.** Wes Moore (the winner of the race for MD governor) is missing from the list of top spenders. I searched through one of the previous datasets and wasn't able to locate Facebook/Meta as a payee for media; however, the Meta ad library returns over 800 ad results when searching his name online. SKDK, a public affairs/political consulting firm was the biggest media expense recipient for the Moore-Miller campaign.

```{r}
media_only_md_expenses_or <- read_csv("data/media_only_md_expenses_or.csv") |>
  
mutate(expenditure_date=mdy(expenditure_date)) |>

filter(
    str_detect(expense_category, "Media") |
    str_detect(committee_name, "Moore") |
    str_detect(committee_name, "Miller")) |>
group_by(payee_clean) |>
  summarise(amount = sum(amount)) |>
arrange(desc(amount))
```

**Q4.** The media expense data you cleaned also has a standardized purpose column. Write code to generate a list of the committees with the total amount of spending on online advertising. How does this list compare to the one from Q1 about top Facebook spenders? Of the top 5 committees who spent the most on Facebook ads from Q1, are there any that appear to have spent *all* of their online advertising dollars on Facebook?

**A4.** Online advertising saw higher spends from PACs rather than from committees directly associated with candidates (Moore and Perez being the exceptions here). None of the committees who spent the most on Facebook ads spent all ther online ad budget on Facebook.

```{r}
cleaned_media_only_md_expenses_or |>

  filter(
    str_detect(expense_purpose, "Online Advertising")) |>
  group_by(committee_name) |>
  summarise(amount = sum(amount)) |>
arrange(desc(amount))
```

**Q5** Your editor asks you to summarize your findings about spending on Facebook by Maryland political candidates. How much do we know and what don't we know? What's the best story idea you've found here?

**A5** Setting aside committees directly associated with candidates, we know which PACs spent money during the the past election cycle but not which candidates they were in support or opposition of without doing additional research. I'd be interested in finding out how much total Facebook ad rev was spent on any/all candidates (if committee only expresses opposition to one candidate but not support of another, maybe deduct from opposition candidate's total spend rather than ignore?).

```{r}
cleaned_media_only_md_expenses_or |>
  
filter(str_detect(payee_clean, "FACEBOOK")) |>
group_by(committee_name) |>
  summarise(amount = sum(amount)) |>
arrange(desc(amount))
```
